# Syncing CrossInk Reading Stats to crosspoint-sync

A firmware integration guide for shipping per-book and overall ("global") reading-stats sync
against `https://sync.crosspointreader.com` (or any self-hosted crosspoint-sync instance).
It maps CrossInk's existing structs (`BookReadingStats`, `GlobalReadingStats`) onto the wire
format 1:1 — no on-device data-model changes are needed.

Full endpoint reference: [docs/API.md](../API.md) (§ Reading stats).

## The model in one paragraph

Stats sync works exactly like CrossInk's nearby (ESP-NOW) stats sync, just with a server in the
middle. **Each device uploads its own snapshot; a re-upload replaces that device's previous
snapshot; nothing is ever merged into another device's numbers.** The server keeps one row per
`(user, device_id)` for global stats and one per `(user, device_id, document)` for book stats,
and computes combined views on read. So the device-side logic is: serialize current stats →
PUT → done. There is no diffing, no conflict handling, and re-sending the same snapshot twice
is harmless.

## Prerequisites (all already in the firmware)

- **Auth**: the same headers the KOReader sync client already sends —
  `x-auth-user` / `x-auth-key` from `KOReaderCredentialStore`. No new credentials.
- **HTTP + TLS**: same `SecureHttpClient` path used for kosync (TLS 1.3 / wolfSSL, ≥55KB heap
  before handshake).
- **JSON**: ArduinoJson.
- **device_id**: any stable per-device string ≤128 chars. Recommendation: reuse whatever the
  kosync client sends as `device_id`, or derive `"crossink-" + MAC hex`. This is the key that
  keeps devices' snapshots separate — it must not change across boots.
- **document hash**: the same 32-hex id used for progress sync (`KOReaderDocumentId`, filename
  or binary method per the device setting). Book stats and progress for the same book should use
  the same hash so a future UI can join them.

## 1. Overall stats — PUT /api/v1/stats/global

Send after a reading session ends (or from the sync menu). One small JSON object, ~500 bytes:

```json
{
  "device_id": "crossink-a1b2c3d4e5f6",
  "device": "CrossInk",
  "v": 5,
  "sessions": 312,
  "seconds": 184300,
  "pages": 9120,
  "completed": 14,
  "tod": [1200, 84000, 60100, 39000],
  "dow": [8000, 9000, 7000, 11000, 12000, 60000, 77300],
  "anchor_day": 9650,
  "history_b64": "<base64 of readingHistoryBits, 92 bytes -> 124 chars>",
  "streak": 21
}
```

Field mapping from `GlobalReadingStats`:

| JSON | struct field | notes |
|------|--------------|-------|
| `v` | — | schema version; send `5` (bump if the struct changes) |
| `sessions` | `totalSessions` | |
| `seconds` | `totalReadingSeconds` | |
| `pages` | `totalPagesTurned` | |
| `completed` | `completedBooks` | |
| `tod` | `timeOfDaySeconds[4]` | [morning, afternoon, evening, night], same order as on device |
| `dow` | `dayOfWeekSeconds[7]` | Mon..Sun, same order as on device |
| `anchor_day` | `readingHistoryAnchorDay` | days since 2000-01-01, unchanged |
| `history_b64` | `readingHistoryBits[92]` | plain base64 of the raw 92 bytes; bit semantics unchanged (bit 0 = anchor day, bit N = anchor_day − N, LSB-first per byte) |
| `streak` | `longestReadingStreak` | |

Response: `200 {"until": 1752345678}`. Non-200 → treat like a kosync sync failure (show error,
retry later); the server state is unchanged on validation failures (`403 {"code":2003,...}`).

Sketch (ArduinoJson):

```cpp
JsonDocument doc; // ~1KB is plenty
doc["device_id"] = deviceId;
doc["device"]    = "CrossInk";
doc["v"]         = 5;
doc["sessions"]  = g.totalSessions;
doc["seconds"]   = g.totalReadingSeconds;
doc["pages"]     = g.totalPagesTurned;
doc["completed"] = g.completedBooks;
JsonArray tod = doc["tod"].to<JsonArray>();
for (auto s : g.timeOfDaySeconds) tod.add(s);
JsonArray dow = doc["dow"].to<JsonArray>();
for (auto s : g.dayOfWeekSeconds) dow.add(s);
doc["anchor_day"]  = g.readingHistoryAnchorDay;
doc["history_b64"] = base64Encode(g.readingHistoryBits.data(), 92);
doc["streak"]      = g.longestReadingStreak;
// PUT to <serverUrl>/api/v1/stats/global with the kosync auth headers
```

## 2. Per-book stats — PUT /api/v1/stats/books

Batch endpoint: up to 20 books per request, one `device_id` per request. Syncing just the
currently open book after each session is the simplest correct behavior; a "sync all" menu action
can page through every book with stats in chunks of 20.

```json
{
  "device_id": "crossink-a1b2c3d4e5f6",
  "items": [
    {
      "document": "25f8abb4f4f5594f02f361726814fea1",
      "v": 5,
      "sessions": 9,
      "seconds": 8400,
      "pages": 310,
      "completed": false,
      "avg_fwd": 12,
      "pace_n": 250,
      "eta": 5400,
      "start_manual": false,
      "finish_manual": false,
      "start_date": 1751000000,
      "finished_date": 0,
      "tod": [0, 3000, 4000, 1400],
      "dow": [0, 0, 1200, 0, 2000, 3000, 2200]
    }
  ]
}
```

Field mapping from `BookReadingStats` (stats_v5):

| JSON | struct field | notes |
|------|--------------|-------|
| `document` | — | same hash used for this book's progress sync |
| `sessions` | `sessionCount` | |
| `seconds` | `totalReadingSeconds` | |
| `pages` | `totalPagesTurned` | |
| `completed` | `isCompleted` | boolean |
| `avg_fwd` | `avgSecondsPerForwardPage` | |
| `pace_n` | `paceSampleCount` | used server-side to weight combined pace |
| `eta` | `estimatedTimeLeftSeconds` | |
| `start_manual` / `finish_manual` | `startDateManual` / `finishedDateManual` | booleans |
| `start_date` / `finished_date` | `startDate` / `finishedDate` | **convert to unix seconds** (midnight UTC of the stored date); send `0` for "not set" |
| `tod` / `dow` | `timeOfDaySeconds` / `dayOfWeekSeconds` | same order as on device |

Response: `200 {"until": ..., "accepted": <n>}`. All integers must be non-negative JSON numbers
and booleans real booleans — the server rejects the whole batch with 403/2003 if any item is
malformed, so nothing partial is written.

## 3. Reading combined stats back (optional, for the stats screen)

- `GET /api/v1/stats/summary` — everything already combined server-side: scalars and `tod`/`dow`
  summed across devices, history bitmaps OR-ed after re-anchoring to the newest `anchor_day`,
  `streak` (all-time longest) and `current_streak` recomputed from the combined calendar. The
  response is the same shape as the global upload plus `current_streak` and a `devices` list —
  render it exactly like the local stats screen renders `GlobalReadingStats`.
- `GET /api/v1/stats/global` — raw per-device snapshots, if you want the nearby-sync-style
  per-device display instead. Note this returns *other devices' snapshots too* — same rule as
  nearby sync: display, never merge into local files.
- `GET /api/v1/stats/books/{document}` — per-device rows plus a `combined` object for one book.

All responses at current data sizes are well under 8KB; parse with a bounded JsonDocument.

## 4. When to sync

Suggested triggers, mirroring the existing kosync UX:

1. **On the existing KOReader-sync action** (user already has WiFi up): after progress sync,
   also PUT global stats + current book's stats. Two extra small requests on an
   already-established connection.
2. **Manual "Sync stats" menu item**: pages through all books with local stats in batches of 20.
3. Never on a timer — WiFi is expensive on this hardware; piggyback on user-initiated syncs.

Ordering doesn't matter and retries are safe (uploads are idempotent replacements). If the device
was offline for a month, one sync catches everything up — snapshots carry totals, not deltas.

## 5. Related integrations worth pairing with stats

- **Document metadata**: book-stats rows are keyed by document hash only. If the device also sends
  the optional `metadata: {filename, title, authors}` object with its progress PUTs (the
  crosspoint-reader "Send Document Metadata" setting, KOReader PR #15306 shape), the server stores
  title/author per document — so any stats UI can show "Foundryside · 2h 20m" instead of a hash.
  No stats-side changes needed; it's a progress-sync feature that stats views benefit from.
- **On-device sign-up**: the server has open registration (`POST /users/create` with
  `{username, password: md5}` → 201, or 402 if taken). crosspoint-reader now exposes this as a
  "Sign Up" button next to Authenticate; CrossInk can mirror that so first-time users never need
  a computer. See `KOReaderSyncClient::createUser()` in crosspoint-reader for a reference
  implementation.
- **Default-server migration caution**: if CrossInk also changes its default sync server to
  crosspoint-sync, replicate crosspoint-reader's config-version migration: a pre-existing config
  with credentials and an *empty* server URL was implicitly syncing to sync.koreader.rocks — pin
  that URL explicitly on upgrade instead of silently moving the user (crosspoint-reader's
  `KOReaderCredentialStore::fromJson` cfgVersion 2 migration is the reference).

## 6. Gotchas

- **Don't sum server data into local files.** Same invariant as nearby sync. Local
  `global_stats.bin` remains this device's truth; the server combines on read.
- **`device_id` stability is the whole ballgame.** If it changes (e.g. derived from a setting a
  user can edit), the server sees a "new device" and totals double. Derive from MAC.
- **Dates**: `ReadingStatsDate` → unix seconds conversion is the only real data transform in this
  integration; `0` means unset on the wire.
- **Bitmap**: send the raw 92 bytes base64'd — do not re-pack or reverse bit order; the server
  uses the device's exact semantics.
- **Heap**: both PUT bodies are < 1.5KB; a single 2KB JsonDocument covers every request and
  response in this guide. The TLS handshake (~55KB) remains the binding constraint, same as
  kosync today.
- **Auth failures** return the familiar kosync error shape (`401 {"code":2001,...}`) — the
  existing error handling paths apply as-is.
